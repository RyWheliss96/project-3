## Project_Description
Our group is attempting to look at the differences between the houses at Hogwarts. Using the data of all of the known characters in the movies, we will be investigating the similarities and differences. We will then create a visualization dashboard to help display the data.<br />

We then created a PowerPoint to help present what was found. That can be found here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_9F5unn04Ntu5zw7uiUeS6xLyVfiSmdIajbLp7erzJI/edit?usp=sharing .<br /> 

## Questions
1. What are the percentages of female vs male in each house?
2. What are the most popular professions to come out of each house?
3. What Blood Status lead to each house?
4. Who are the people from the books in each house? Count?

Python File -> app\_solution.py creates a Flask API which powers the mongoDB database in a json format for access when run locally <br />
Pandas Notebook -> mongodb\_creation.ipynb which creates the mongodb database, removes the duplicates and reenters data to be used. Data is fully manipulated in file and tested.<br />
README.md <br />
